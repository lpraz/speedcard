# Speedcard
Train yourself with flashcards, but faster. Made with an emphasis on speed for
internalizing responses as a reflex.

## How to Use
Speedcard will flash a card at you, and you must select the correct answer as
quickly as possible. Keys 1 through 9 are usable as shortcuts for the first
9 buttons.

Statistics about your performance will be displayed in the upper-left-hand
corner. The upper-right-hand corner has controls for the trainer, including
a start/stop button, a reset button for the statistics, a flashcard editor
dialog, and an optional timeout for giving answers to cards.

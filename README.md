# Speedcard
Train yourself with flashcards, but faster. Made with an emphasis on speed for
internalizing responses as a reflex.

## How to Use
Speedcard will flash a card at you, and you must select the correct answer as
quickly as possible. Keys 1 through 9 are usable as shortcuts for the first
9 buttons.

Currently comes with a Rock-Paper-Scissors example.
